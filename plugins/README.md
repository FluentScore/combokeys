# Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of Combokeys.

Since this project was forked from
[ccampbell/mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)
and was converted to CommonJS, the plugins were not converted to CommonJS.

## Bind dictionary

Allows you to make multiple bindings in a single ``Combokeys.bind`` call.

## Global bind

Allows you to set global bindings that work even inside of input fields.

## Pause/unpause

Allows you to temporarily prevent Combokeys events from firing.

## Record

Allows you to capture a keyboard shortcut or sequence defined by a user.
